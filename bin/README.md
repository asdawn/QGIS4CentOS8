*These binaries (with source codes) are compiled under a virtual machine, however the CPU model (AMD Zen2) might affect the binaries.
I suggest you compile it yourself, unless time is not enough.*

```bash
7za x D.7z.001
cd cd libspatialindex/  
sudo make install
cd ..
cd qgis3.14.1
cd build
sudo make install
```

To make it work, please refer to README.md of this project. Step 4, 5 and 6 can be skipped.
